## 🚀 About Me  
I’m a data-driven problem solver with 4+ years of IT + data experience, now transitioning into **AI/ML, Cloud, and Data Engineering**.  

Currently on a **3–4 month build sprint** to create a portfolio of real-world, deployable projects that highlight:  
- ML model integration with APIs  
- Data pipelines + dashboards  
- Cloud deployment (AWS)  
- LLM and agent-based systems

## 🧩 Featured Projects (Work in Progress)  

🚑 **Healthcare API Enhancer** *(Flagship Project)*  
FastAPI microservice with ML predictions, LLM-powered symptom summarization, and triaging logic.  
_Status: Phase 2 (ML model integration in progress)_  

📊 **Real-Time Pricing Dashboard**  
Python + PostgreSQL ETL pipeline with a React dashboard for liquor pricing trends.  
_Status: ETL + dashboard skeleton planned (starting October 2025)_  

🤖 **GPT Agent Orchestration (MCP-enabled)**  
LangChain multi-agent workflow that processes resumes and documents with vector search + MCP.  
_Status: Architecture drafted, coding planned_  

🌩️ **AWS Cloud Cost Optimizer**  
Lambda + DynamoDB tool that monitors AWS usage and sends SNS alerts.  
_Status: MVP planned for September 2025_

## 🔎 Practice & Prototype Repos  

📚 **SQL Practice** → [sql-practice](https://github.com/Veena-K-Venugopal/sql-practice)  
Solutions to SQL interview-style problems (DataLemur, LeetCode). Well-documented with inline comments.  

📑 **Billing Ticket Classifier**  
Prototype NLP workflow using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression for simple classification tasks.  

📊 **Mini Pretraining Tracker**  
Simulated training logs across mock data batches, visualized overfitting markers with Pandas + Matplotlib.  

🧹 **Pretraining Data Cleaner**  
Filtering/sampling pipeline using Hugging Face Datasets (deduplication + entry length filtering).  

🔣 **Token Frequency Visualizer**  
Analyzes token distributions from pretrained tokenizers. Highlights entropy + rare/overrepresented tokens.  

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack  
**Languages**: Python, SQL, Java, C, C++  
**ML/AI**: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Hugging Face, LangChain, FAISS  
**Cloud/Infra**: AWS (Lambda, ECS, S3, Redshift), Render, Firebase  
**Data**: PostgreSQL, SQLite, Supabase  
**Visualization**: Streamlit, Tableau, Grafana, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**DevOps**: Git/GitHub, Docker (in progress), CI/CD basics
