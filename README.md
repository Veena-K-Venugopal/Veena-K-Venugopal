I'm a data-driven problem solver with 3+ years of experience in IT and data analysis, blending curiosity with code to solve real-world problems. I currently work as an IT Support/ Business Analyst where I actively apply Python, SQL, and Splunk to monitor customer trends and improve system performance.

I’m building a portfolio that reflects my transition into roles at the intersection of **AI, machine learning, cloud computing, and data engineering** — with a strong emphasis on clean design, LLM integration, and impactful use cases.

## 🧠 Super Cool Projects (In Progress)

🚑 **Healthcare API Enhancer**  
Expanding a FastAPI project with LLM-powered symptom summarization, structured EHR outputs, and smart triaging recommendations.

📄 **Smart Resume Ranker**  
Uses OpenAI Embeddings + FAISS to score resume–job matches and highlight optimization suggestions. Built with Streamlit.

💬 **Chat with Docs (RAG Bot)**  
Upload docs and ask questions — a chatbot built with LangChain + vector search over your data (RAG pipeline project).

📊 **Real-time Pricing Dashboard**  
Scrapes and visualizes liquor pricing trends using Python, PostgreSQL, and React dashboards. Includes trend alerts and auto-refreshing data.

🧠 **Customer Churn Prediction**  
Predicting churn using classification models and behavior patterns from mock customer data. Includes EDA and explainability.

📈 **Budget Tracker with ML Insights**  
Tracks personal expenses and flags risky spending patterns using ML forecasting and simple NLP.

🤖 **Liquor Store Chatbot**  
A customer-facing assistant built with Dialogflow and Flask — recommends products, checks inventory, and handles common queries.

🌩️ **AWS Cloud Cost Optimizer**  
Monitors usage and sends alerts via SNS when thresholds are exceeded. Uses AWS Lambda + DynamoDB.

🌐 **Social Sentiment Dashboard**  
Live sentiment analysis of tweets or Reddit threads on trending topics using Hugging Face models and chart visualizations.

🔬 **Quantum Concepts Visualizer** (Paused)  
Exploring Qiskit basics to develop visual and interactive learning tools for quantum intuition.

🧬 **LLM Data & Pretraining Experiments**

📑 **Billing Ticket Classifier (Token-Based)**  
Preprocessed sample tickets using NLP tokenization (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression). Iteratively improved taxonomy and tracked misclassifications.

📊 **Mini Pretraining Tracker**  
Simulated training logs across mock data batches. Visualized learning rate shifts and overfitting signs with Pandas + Matplotlib.

🧹 **Pretraining Data Sampler & Cleaner** (In Progress)  
Built a filter/sampler pipeline for LLM-scale datasets using Hugging Face Datasets. Removes noisy records and logs dataset stats.

🔣 **Token Frequency Visualizer** (In Progress)  
Analyzes token distributions from various tokenizers. Flags high-entropy and rare tokens to guide better dataset design.
